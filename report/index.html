                This comprehensive report outlines my professional activities and achievements as an Assistant Professor at the Kerala School of Mathematics (KSoM) from February 2019 to May 2025. It covers my contributions in research, teaching, student supervision, and various administrative capacities, highlighting the impact and scope of my work within the institution and the broader academic community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                It is important to note that during this period, KSoM operated with a very limited number of faculty members. Consequently, a substantial portion of the administrative workload fell upon my shoulders. While I am proud of the diverse contributions detailed herein, it is worth considering this exceptional administrative commitment when evaluating my research output, as it does not fully capture the entirety of my research capabilities during this tenure.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The Minkowski function is a crucial tool in the study of balanced and, more generally, quasi-balanced domains in several complex variables. For a bounded and pseudoconvex quasi-balanced domain, its Minkowski function is known to be plurisubharmonic. This work demonstrates that with the additional assumption of a smooth boundary, the Minkowski function of a quasi-balanced domain is in fact smooth away from the origin. This result facilitates the construction of a smooth plurisubharmonic defining function for such domains and is a novel finding even in the case of balanced domains. This is a joint work with Jaikrishnan Janardhanan (IIT Palakkad) and was published in <em>Complex Variables and Elliptic Equations</em> in 2021. A significant portion of this work was completed at the Chennai Mathematical Institute.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This paper investigates proper holomorphic self-maps on quasi-balanced domains in $\mathbb C^3$ with specific boundary regularity properties. A long-standing conjecture in Several Complex Variables posits that proper holomorphic self-maps of any smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb C^n$ are necessarily automorphisms. This was proven for the unit ball in $\mathbb C^n, n>1$ by Alexander (1977), and extended to strictly pseudoconvex domains by Pinchuk (1980). Subsequent work by Bedford and Bell (1982) and Huang and Pan (1996) further demonstrated this for weakly pseudoconvex domains with real-analytic boundaries.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The primary objective of this paper is to establish Alexander-type theorems for smoothly bounded quasi-balanced domains of finite type in $\mathbb C^3$. Specifically, the paper proves that every proper holomorphic self-mapping of a smoothly-bounded pseudoconvex quasi-balanced domain of (D’Angelo) finite type is an automorphism. This is a joint work with Jaikrishnan Janardhanan and was published in <em>Complex Analysis and its Synergies</em> in 2023.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The study of Braid groups, initiated by Artin in 1925, remains a classical and active area of research due to their crucial role in knot theory, link theory, and 3-manifolds. The study of their representations also continues to be an active area, with connections to quantum groups and knot invariants. Surface braid groups, defined as the fundamental group of the configuration space over an arbitrary compact surface, are an equally interesting object of study. While Curtis McMullen (2012) explored unitary representations of the braid group via Hodge theory of cyclic branched coverings of $\mathbb P^1$, this ongoing work investigates the geometric representation of the surface braid group. The manuscript is nearing completion. This is a joint work with Saswathi Mukherjee and Chitrabhanu Chaudhuri (NISER Bhubaneswar).

                        This work, in collaboration with my PhD scholar Ms. Athira E. V., focuses on the study of liftability of braids and, more generally, of the mapping class group in the case of general cyclic branched covers over $\mathbb{P}^1$. This research extends existing work by Tyrone Ghaswala and Winarski on specific covers over $\mathbb{P}^1$, aiming to identify and characterize the liftable mapping class groups in this broader context. Additionally, a study of the geometric representations of the pure braid groups is planned as an integral part of this project.

                The Integrated MSc-PhD program at KSoM commenced in 2020. I played a pivotal role in its inception, actively participating in extensive deliberations with subject experts and the University of Calicut on regulations and curriculum. I was instrumental in managing all related documentation, which significantly contributed to the program's successful launch and subsequent operation.

I have been deeply involved in developing and maintaining automated processes for course record-keeping, mark collection, consolidation of mark lists, and generation of grade cards and tabulated registers for the University of Calicut. As the <em>Students Affairs in-charge</em>, I serve as the primary point of contact for students regarding any concerns.

By studying elliptic functions, the behavior of meromorphic functions on the torus was elucidated. The dissertation also delved into the Weierstrass $\wp$-function, a primary example of an elliptic function with two poles, and its properties, including how any elliptic function can be expressed as a rational function of $\wp$ and its derivative. <em>Anagha has successfully transitioned to a role at IBM India in Bangalore, applying her analytical skills developed during her project.</em>

                        This course focused on de Branges' Proof of the Bieberbach Conjecture. Schlicht functions are univalent functions $f:\mathbb{D}(0,1) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ normalized such that $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$. The Bieberbach conjecture, proven by Louis de Branges in 1985, states that if $f(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n z^n$ is a Schlicht function, then $|a_n|\leq n$. Faheem's study included the historical context, such as Bieberbach's proof for $|a_2|\leq 2$ (1916) and Löwner's proof for $|a_3|\leq 3$ (1923), culminating in de Branges' general proof. <em>Faheem is continuing his doctoral studies at IISc Bangalore, demonstrating the solid preparation gained through his research on the Bieberbach Conjecture.</em>

Second, she explored the elementary properties of holomorphic functions on Riemann surfaces and the construction of algebraic functions. <em>Aiswarya is continuing her doctoral studies at TIFR Mumbai, a testament to her strong foundational work in this course.</em>

                        The main goal of this dissertation was to study a generalized notion of convexity, its preservation under biholomorphisms, and its characterizations. The project involved an in-depth study of elementary properties of holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}^n$, with particular attention to plurisubharmonicity and its role in pseudoconvexity. Various notions of convexity and pseudoconvexity and their characterizations, including the Cartan-Thullen theorem, were explored.

                        I served as the local coordinator for this workshop, held from December 2 to December 7, 2024. It brought together young researchers and experts in complex, arithmetic, and ergodic dynamics, featuring mini-courses on quasiconformal techniques, ergodic theory of group actions on homogeneous spaces, and topics from arithmetic dynamics (Berkovich dynamics and moduli spaces), with a focus on their interplay. The workshop also included several research talks.
